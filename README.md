# Source 2013 imgui

This repo contains an imgui implementation for Source 2013 based on the one we developed for Strata Source (Portal 2: Community Edition, Momentum Mod, etc.)

## Integrating

1. Add this repo as a submodule to your Source mod
2. Include the VPC file in your client\_base.vpc
3. Download [`imgui.lib`](https://github.com/Liberty-Interactive/Void-Modding-Tool/blob/main/lib/imgui.lib) and move it to `src/lib/public`
4. open `source_dll_win32_base.vpc` and add
```cpp
$Implib "$LIBPUBLIC\imgui"
```
right after `$Implib "$LIBPUBLIC\vstdlib"`
5. Add the following code to cdll\_client\_int.cpp

At the top of the file:
```cpp
#include "imgui/imgui_system.h"
```

Towards the end of `CHLClient::Init`:
```cpp
g_pImguiSystem->Init();
```

At the start of `CHLClient::Shutdown`:
```cpp
g_pImguiSystem->Shutdown();
```

4. That's it!

## Limitations

* Interop with vgui isn't the greatest, as we need to intercept input from vgui itself and redirect it to imgui. An invisible popup panel is used for this purpose.
